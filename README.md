## ML-Based Demonetization twitter Sentiment Analysis
## UI Design + ML Models + PPT Presentation 
## Team name - Team BugZero
This project is a part of the hackathon Truminds AI Track. 
The project analyzes the sentiments of twitter users and displays the report. This uses a Machine Learning NLP approach to analyze 
tweets and number of retweets and provide positive, negative and neutral scores as the output. The ML Model also also generated visualisations as charts and graphs.

The study analyses impacts on the GDP of India, employement rate, and the overall economy. The study shows that the demonetization movement had more short-term impacts than long-term aand it 
generally failed to achieve its main objective.

We wish to carry this project forward and therefore have planned the functionalities of our future webapp based on ML model and developed our ideas as UI designs as well:)


## Tech Stack/Files included:
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)
